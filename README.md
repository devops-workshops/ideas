In an attempt to be open about building some workshops, and having a central location for some code shenanigans, this repo is a simple place to submit and talk about ideas for things to do.

## Goals of workshops

In trying to do some workshops to do at meetups etc, the end goals of building this is a bit multifold and depends on who you ask.

Some of the goals are:

* Building community collaboration
* Creating space for alternatives to presentations
* Increasing approachability to these topics

## Themes

Following are the themes that we would like to focus the workshops under.

* Platform Knowledge
  * eg. Cloud infrastructure, service infrastructure
* Automation
* Architecture Paradigms
  * Code
  * Infrastructure
* Troubleshooting/Game Day
  * eg. "Let's break something and see how we would figure out how to fix it"
* Security/Ethics
* Communication

## Current Ideas

* The basics of systems and infrastructure design
* Configuration management for the container age
* Designing Reliability: How to acheive zero downtime
  * Apache Bench, etc.
* Observability 101/201
  * What even
  * How even
* Build-A-Cluster: Kubernetes the hard way
* CI and Release Engineering: Building reliable pipelines
  * Terraform
  * Application
  * Tools
    * CircleCI
    * GitLabCI
    * GitHub Actions
    * Brigade
* Getting started with Terraform remote modules
* Container Anthropology: Dealing with Multi-stage Docker builds
